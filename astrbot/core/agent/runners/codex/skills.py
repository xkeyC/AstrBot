"""AstrBot skills for the Codex runner.

Codex threads run without a local execution environment by default, so the
model cannot `cat` a SKILL.md. Skills are listed in the prompt the way Codex
lists its own (the format and trigger rules its models are trained on) and
read on demand through the ``astrbot_read_skill`` tool, which only opens files
inside the directory of a skill offered to the current event -- on this host,
or in the sandbox when skills live there (shipyard mode).

A skill the user names outright is not left to the model: its SKILL.md is
loaded into that turn, as Codex does for an explicit ``$skill`` mention.

- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR \
the task clearly matches a skill's description above, you must use that skill \
for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across \
turns unless re-mentioned.
- How to use a skill: read its `SKILL.md` completely with `{_READ_CALL}` before \
taking task actions; pass `path` (e.g. `scripts/run.py`, `references/`) to open \
a file or folder it references. A skill already loaded into this turn under \
`<request_context name="skill:NAME">` needs no second read.
- Prefer running or adapting a skill's scripts and assets over recreating them. \
Announce which skill you are using in one short line.
- If a skill cannot be read or applied, say so briefly and continue with the \
best fallback."""
